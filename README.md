# CLARM
### Conditional Latent Autoregressive Recurrent Model for spatiotemporal learning
#### CLARM is a unsupervised deep learning approach to learn spatiotemporal dynamics. CLARM consists of a CVAE and LSTM combined together in an autoregressive loop to learn spatial and temporal dynamics independently. Here, CVAE learns spatial correlations of the high dimensional objects in a low-dimensional latent space distribution and a RNN like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) learn the temporal dynamics within the latent space.
