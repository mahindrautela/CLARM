# CLARM
### Conditional Latent Autoregressive Recurrent Model for spatiotemporal learning
#### CLARM is a unsupervised deep learning approach to learn spatiotemporal dynamics. CLARM consists of a CVAE and LSTM combined together in an autoregressive loop to learn spatial and temporal dynamics independently. Here, CVAE learns spatial correlations of the high dimensional objects in a low-dimensional latent space distribution and a RNN like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) learn the temporal dynamics within the latent space. Using CVAE part, new realistic samples can generated by conditionally sampling the latent space followed by decoding. Using LSTM part, the future states in the downstream locations can be forecasted given few initial states as inputs. 

#### The CLARM is used to learn spatialtemporal evolution of 6D phase space of charged beams in particle accelerators. This repository contains codes accompanying the [paper]{link coming}. 


#### The dataset accompying the paper is available at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/10.5281/zenodo.10819001).
